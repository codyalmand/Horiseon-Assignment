# User Story
As a marketing agency,
I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards
so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

# Acceptance Criteria
A webpage meets accessibility standards when:

1. Viewing the source code, I find semantic HTML elements.
2. Viewing the structure of the HTML elements,
I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
3. Viewing the image elements, I find accessible alt attributes.
4. Viewing the heading attributes, I find they fall in sequential order.
5. Viewing the title element, I find a concise, descriptive title.
